## Introduction
Since the rise of The Onion Router (TOR) Darknet Markets have seen a rise in popularity. Darknet markets such as Silkroad, the RealDeal and AlphaBay are used to offer products and services ranging from drugs and child pornography to stolen accounts and zero day exploits. The free availability of software vulnerabilities and zero day exploits is a significant security issue for companies or governmental institutes. For example in the Stuxnet case an Iranian nuclear reactor was infected by a computer worm suspectedly being developped by America in alliance with Isreal. They were able to control the centrifuges without the operators being able to notice. Other cases include the DigiNotar hack in 2011 where SSL certificates for Dutch governmental services were stolen. The Stuxnet, DigaNotar and many other cases give enough foundation for organisations to think about the current risks and the assets that they want to protect.
