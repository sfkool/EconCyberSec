## Introduction
Since the rise of The Onion Router (TOR) Darknet Markets have seen a rise in popularity. Darknet markets such as Silkroad, the RealDeal and AlphaBay are used to offer products and services ranging from drugs and child pornography to stolen accounts and zero day exploits. Because of these software vulnerabilities being sold large companies that depend on IT infrastructures are at risk. For example in the Stuxnet case an Iranian nuclear reactor was infected by a computer worm suspectedly being developped by America in alliance with Isreal. They were able to control the centrifuges without the operators being able to notice. Cases such as the Stuxnet case give enough foundation for organisations to think about the current risks and the assets that they want to protect.
