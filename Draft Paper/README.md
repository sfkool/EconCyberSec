## Introduction
Since the rise of The Onion Router (TOR) Darknet Markets have seen a rise in popularity. Darknet markets such as Silkroad, the RealDeal and AlphaBay are used to offer products and services ranging from drugs and child pornography to stolen accounts and zero day exploits. The free availability of software vulnerabilities and zero day exploits is a significant security issue for companies or governmental institutes. For example in the Stuxnet case an Iranian nuclear reactor was infected by a computer worm suspectedly being developped by America in alliance with Isreal. They were able to control the centrifuges without the operators being able to notice. Other cases include the DigiNotar hack in 2011 where SSL certificates for Dutch governmental services were stolen. The Stuxnet, DigaNotar and many other cases give enough foundation for organisations to think about the current risks and the assets that they want to protect.

## Context

## Metrics
To measure the security threat caused my darknet markets we take a look at multiple metrics.

**Supply**
First of all we take a look at the supply of unique suppliers. When there is a high supply of a cyber asset the price will be likely to drop and the cyber asset is more likely to be bought and used.

**Price**
The price of a cyber asset together with the supply determines the availability to the users of the market. The lower the price is the higher the likelihood will be that users buy it and use it.

**Demand**
Some cyber assets might be more demanded then others. A zero day exploit might be demanded because of its often high impact and low supply. On the opposite there is often a great supply of leaked email addresses which generally have a low impact on the security of an IT system.

**Impact**
The impact of the cyber asset generally determines the price and the demand. A zero day exploit that can potentially gain access to the complete system will generally have a higher demand then a few random emailaddresses that could be used to send spam.
