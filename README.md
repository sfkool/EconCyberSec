# EconCyberSec

Each group must use a single shared github repository. Store the following in your github repository:

1. Assignment draft -  It should contain the methodology, a description of the steps you will follow to solve the assignment and any preliminary result. This draft must be a pdf file located in the root directory.
2. Final assignment report - It should contain the results of the data analysis and the answers to the assignment questions. The report must be a pdf file located in the root directory.
3. Any project code you have developed to process the data.
4. Data - Include all the data that you used in your project. If the data is too large for github store it on a cloud storage provider, such as Dropbox or Yousendit.


Others:
* EdX discussion forum: each group will have a private discussion forum for each assignment. Before the due date of the final assignment, each group will create a new post stating the contribution of each of the team members.
* 2 reviews of group assignments


## Block 2 assignment

During Block 2, you have learnt the importance of measuring cybersecurity and the challenges to create meaningful metric. However, metrics are necessary to show how security activity contributes directly to security goals; measure how changes in a process contribute to security goals; detect significant anomalies in processes and inform decisions to fix or improve processes.

In this assignment you will analyze the dataset your group has chosen. Your deliverable must describe:

* What security issue does the data speak to?
* What would be the ideal metrics for security decision makers?
* What are the metrics that exist in practice?
* A definition of the metrics you can design from the dataset
* An evaluation of the the metrics you have defined. This should include graphical representations of the metrics (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, time series, bar charts).


Due dates:
* Draft: Monday, September 26 - 12:00pm
* Final report: Monday, October 03- 12:00pm
* Peer reviews: Tuesday, October 04 - 12:00pm
