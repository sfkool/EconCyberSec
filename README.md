Each group must use a single shared github repository. Store the following in your github repository:

1. Assignment draft -  It should contain the methodology, a description of the steps you will follow to solve the assignment and any preliminary result. This draft must be a pdf file located in the root directory.
2. Final assignment report - It should contain the results of the data analysis and the answers to the assignment questions. The report must be a pdf file located in the root directory.
3. Any project code you have developed to process the data.
4. Data - Include all the data that you used in your project. If the data is too large for github store it on a cloud storage provider, such as Dropbox or Yousendit.


Others:
* EdX discussion forum: each group will have a private discussion forum for each assignment. Before the due date of the final assignment, each group will create a new post stating the contribution of each of the team members.
* 2 reviews of group assignments
